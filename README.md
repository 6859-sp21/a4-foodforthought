# A4: Food for Thought Project Documentation

## Background 

Our team chose to focus on the environmental impact of food based on our common interests in social impact and topics that affect people around the world. Thus, every decision in our design process was guided by a desire to leave an impact and strong impression on the average user audience of our tool without being overwhelming or overly complex. 

In our research, we came across a paper that seemed to be cited repeatedly in many of the articles we read: [Reducing foodâ€™s environmental impacts through producers and consumers](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987) (Poore and Nemecek, 2018). This paper includes a broad overview of the global impacts of food production, comparing various types of production systems for more than 40 agricultural commodities from around the world. The dataset from the paper measures impact through five environmental indicators: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, land use, freshwater withdrawal, eutrophication potential, and acidification potential. While we often only consider emissions in our analysis of environmental impact, this dataset is unique in that it includes a more comprehensive account of factors that can cause environmental trade-offs and can't be captured through only emissions data. 

## Design Decisions

We first decided to create a set of interactive visualizations with the animation technique of "scrollytelling," as we analyzed in some of the lecture examples. We felt this medium would best incorporate a strong narrative into our visualization, allowing each graph to tell a story that builds on the previous one. Especially for users without much background on the topic, we thought this format would be more digestible and conducive to a linear story. 

For the first graph, we wanted to use a format that gave a broad overview of how food production has a significant environmental impact. In our research, one of the facts that stood out to us was that **food contributes to nearly a third of global GHG emissions.** To illustrate this to our users, we thought it would be best to use a treemap format. The treemap first shows both food and non-food as the main categories, but we wanted to keep the subcategories underneath food and non-food grayed out as to draw the reader in to the many complex processes that go into the main categories, which we usually don't notice or think about. 

**A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings, interaction, and animation techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

- **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time? (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ion0fPCR9kv_oxrwtSAnY4OMmPUoXg2SYjhlvtjqQC0/edit?usp=sharing)
